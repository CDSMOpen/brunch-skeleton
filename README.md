First pull down the skeleton by executing

    git clone git@github.com:CDSMOpen/brunch-skeleton.git my-new-project

Then delete the .git hidden folder in /my-new-project. Update the name attributes in package.json and bower.json.

Run

    git init
    git checkout develop

Now simply stage and commit this repository as your initial version. If using a remote repository now is a good time to push it there.

Run
